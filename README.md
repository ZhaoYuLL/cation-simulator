# Ian and Zhao's **physics-final** game
a platformer with electrostatic forces

Navigate a cation through fields of point charges, coins, and death walls. Earn points by getting coins, lose points by taking too long. Can you beat level 10?

### Installation

Download the repo, and open `index.html` in a web browser. It should function, even without an internet connection.

*Please note*: The level might lag and overload the RAM when you first load it, but the important thing is not to panic.
*this repo only has Ian's commits since it was an in person project

If you wish to reset your locally stored game data, open the console in developer tools and type `resetData(); storeData();`.
