most pressing to-do tasks:
collisions system (ending the game or bouncing the particle or colliding with a coin)
 - playerCharge position, radius, and velocity will be passed to level.js
 - the points and their colors will be found using a hitbox style loop.
    - if a black color is found, the game basically ends automatically
    - if a yellow color is found (coins will have a two-tone image texture), the correct coins is found and disappeared, points increase
    - if a blue/black or red/black color is found, the game also ends automatically (maybe an explosion animation is triggered)
    - i think bouncing the particle will be too hard and not necessary for the game

***above is done except coins***

 - next game status and points will be return to level.js
contour lines
 - drawEquis() will be updated
 - non-constant obbies will have a function equiFactor() that will return the factor to multiply when summing the table.
 - also, non-constant obbies will have a function timeStep that must be called iteratively by the level class and initiated in game.js
 - if the obbies move, then calculate table function will be called again
 - we might have an easier time if we have multiple transparent canvases stacked over each other, and we split it into different folders
   for the script. not easier, but faster anyway.
 - for optimization, we'll probably want to preload the contour lines onto a separate transparent canvas in the background
    - we'll have several polygonal contour lines with their times, and p5 will calculate a linear interpolation based on the time
wires magnetic field
move the winbox functions around
nicer html design
port to OpenGL / C++ in the final weekend

#### game.js
canvasParent
CTX_CAMERA, CTX_htmlWIDTH, CTX_htmlHEIGHT, CTX_playerCharge, CTX_level
pX, pY, p, sX, sY, s
gameStatus, fireCharge, startTime, points

force_applied(mass, acceleration), outBox(x, y, r), inControlSpace(mX, mY, pCharge)
loadLevel(n) : sets CTX_level, CTX_CAMERA, CTX_playerCharge, points, startTime
setup() : creates canvas
inControlSpace(mX, mY, pC) : checks if mouse is close enough to player charge
draw() :
 - sets CTX_html*
 - draws background-equis-obbies-barriers-coins-winbox
 - checks collisions
 - draw CTX_playerCharge
 - controls (draw + apply force)
 - checks winbox collision
 - checks canvas border collision (should re-order these last two to be with collisions)
 - applies CTX_level.FeAtPoint to CTX_playerCharge
 - CTX_playerCharge.move();
 - clears forces
 - clears fireCharge

#### level.js
init : pseudo-language that accepts (PC, RW, WB, CN)
    this : x, y, w, h, px, py, pm, pq, res, obbies, barriers, coins, winbox, const_voltageTable
---------------------------------------------
FeAtPoint(x,y,q) : calculates net electric force from obbies at a point
FmAtPoint(x,y,v,q) : calculates net magnetic force from obbies at a point
drawEquis() : will do contour lines, doesn't yet
drawObbies() : should probably draw the endbox here, too
drawBarriers() : 
drawCoins() : 
drawBackground() : simply a cosmetic feature
inEndbox(coords) : empty, probably should replace game.js's outBox()
checkCollisions() : check if player charge collided with something, handle bounce and return whether game ended
colliding(charge) : bounce the player charge if the center is over a black pixel

#### playerCharge.js
init : x, y, mass, charge
    this : x, y, r, vx, vy, ax, ay, m, q, controlRadius
---------------------------------------------
applyForce(F), clearForces, move(t) : applies forces, clears forces, moves
draw() : draws + sends info of player charge to index.html
    those info being:
    - acceleration : ((this.ax ** 2 + this.ay ** 2) ** 0.5)
    - charge : this.q 


#### pointCharge.js
init: x, y, charge
    this : x, y, q, constantVoltage
---------------------------------------------
field(x,y) : calculating field for forces in draw
setVoltageTable(w,h,res) : creates constant voltage of voltage of a point charge when a level is created. array of tables.
draw() : draw + updates color

#### screens.js
levelSelect, winScreen, loseScreen, btn, btn2
---------------------------------------------
callLevel(num) : calls the level that the player clicks on
win(): displays winning screen, pauses music
lose() : displays losing screen, pauses muisc
restartButton(): takes player to home screen when clicked (maybe change to callLevel(num) instead)
LEVEL_DATA{} : sets up the level width and height, 
            sets up the position and amount of:
            - obstacles,
            - point charges, 
            - player charge  
            - polyWalls,etc

#### winbox.js
init: x,y,w,h
    this: x,y,w,h
---------------------------------------------
inBox(x,y) : checks if playerCharge is inside the winbox
draw() : draws a rectangular winbox
