Ramp/rollercoaster:
 - ball
 - track
 - start and end
 - track elements
    - friction part
    - speed and ice parts
    - loop-de-loops
    - range of acceptable distance and end
 - select and move the element
 - tracking velocity, acceleration, normal force
 - accounting for when the ball isn't on the track
 - level system
 - gravity
 - racing two balls

extra features to account for
 - zoom in/out
 - more and more track element types
 - air resistance?
 - more abilities to modify the track elements
 - graphics
 - real-time skipping the frame?





GENERAL NOTES:
 - we are calculating each frame as 1/60th of a second, during which all forces and accelerations are constant, but re-calculated each frame
 - maybe 1/30th if too laggy
